* Features

This configuration is forked from [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][purcell/emacs.d]] . I change the elpa repos to [[https://elpa.emacs-china.org][Emacs-China]]

* Install

Run command in your shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/YuanPre/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party packages will be automatically downloaded and installed.
If you encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly running  =M-x package-refresh-contents= before doing so.

* Others

See [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d/blob/master/README.md][Purcell's README]]
